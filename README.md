# Sales_Analysis
This project is inspired by the work of Keith Galli, available on his GitHub repository: Pandas Data Science Tasks (https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks). Keith presents a series of intriguing questions related to a dataset, providing an excellent opportunity to practice our skills in data manipulation and analysis using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

## Key Challenges
Throughout this project, we will tackle the following challenges:

Best Month for Sales and Earnings: We will determine the best-performing month in terms of sales and calculate the total earnings for that specific month.
Top-Selling City: Identifying the city that generated the highest sales volume in terms of ordered quantity.
Optimal Advertisement Timing: Investigating the optimal time for displaying advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases.
Frequently Purchased Products: Discovering which products are often purchased together.
Best-Selling Product: Identifying the product that achieved the highest sales, and offering insights into the factors contributing to its success.
To address these questions, we will leverage the power of Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

## Project Approach
Rather than simply following the tutorial, this project encourages active engagement and problem-solving. I will independently work through each question, utilizing Pandas for data manipulation and analysis and Matplotlib for data visualization. My goal is not only to answer these questions but also to understand the underlying techniques and concepts involved in the process.

By the end of this project, I aim to have a deeper understanding of data science techniques and gain more confidence in using Pandas and Matplotlib for real-world data analysis tasks.

Let's embark on this data-driven journey, exploring the dataset and uncovering valuable insights along the way!
